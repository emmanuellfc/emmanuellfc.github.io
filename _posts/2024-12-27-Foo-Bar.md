We're too busy, always too busy, and it seems that sometimes we forgot to 
make a pause, take a deep breath and be more present, enjoy the moment and
be in "sync with the world". I'm pretty sure that's not particular to me but
it's someting that all of us struggle with. In any case I just wanted to write
a few lines about it, maybe it will help you, and for sure it will help me.

This year was pretty intense, but honestly it was also incredible!, On one hand
I think I made a step up in my academic career, I'm feeling more comfortable
with how I manage my time and the time it takes to make some good progress.
I'm also feeeling more confident with my group and my PI, which is great!
There are a lot of things that I still need to work in the upcoming year,
but I'm happy and confident that I'm going to be fine. 

I just need to keep working and improving, just a tiny bit everyday will make a huge
difference on the long run.
