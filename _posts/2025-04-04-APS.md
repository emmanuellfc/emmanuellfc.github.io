A couple of weeks ago I had the opportunity to share some of the research I've been doing
with my advisor, Prof. Atherton, at the APS March Meeting. It was a really positive experience, especially because I had the chance to hear some excellent talks. Perhaps not the primary takeaway, but I also learned from observing pitfalls to avoid, i.e., not adhering to the time limit, 
ineffective presentation style, and poor information delivery.
If I had to use just one word to describe my experience at the meeting, it would be: **formative**.
Regarding my presentation, I was nervous. Since this was my first APS meeting, I suppose that's natural â€“ just part of the process. My advisor said it was a good presentation. I even received some questions from the audience during the session, and fielded more questions later from friends in the department.
Overall, I had a very positive experience, and I hope to improve my presentation skills and do even better next time.
