> I am a first-year PhD student at Tufts University in the Department of Physics and Astronomy. My main area of research is soft condensed matter, specifically focusing on liquid crystals and active nematics, with an emphasis on numerical methods, particularly finite elements. I am proficient in Python and Julia, and currently learning Go, C, C++, and Rust. Additionally, I have an interest in differential geometry, differential forms, machine learning, and various other mathematical topics. I am actively learning new concepts with the hope of incorporating them into my research in the near future.
