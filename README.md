# Emmanuel Flores - Personal Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal website and portfolio! This site represents my online presence, detailing my work, projects, and professional background.

## Overview

This is a static, pure HTML/CSS lightweight website hosted on GitHub Pages. It's designed to be minimal, responsive, and easy to maintain.

## Setup & Deployment

1. The website is served directly from the `main` branch.
2. A `.nojekyll` file is included in the root directory to bypass GitHub's default Jekyll build process, ensuring the pure HTML content is served directly.

## Credits & Inspiration

A special thanks to [kaisugi.me](https://github.com/kaisugi/kaisugi.me) for the design inspiration. Their clean aesthetic greatly influenced the current look and feel of this site!
